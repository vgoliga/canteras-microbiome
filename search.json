The TOC maximum of Peña la Vieja also stands out. Moving to figure Figure 5 we observe that it was measured at the end of the monitoring period in the spring of 2023. On the other hand, TON dropped in El Confital 1 and Peña la Vieja between October 2022 and April 2023. This is not the case at Hotel Cristina. Further investigation is needed in order to understand the factors driving these processes.\nIn both Figure 4 and Figure 6, we can observe a difference between El Confital and Las Canteras. Concretely, Si(OH)₄ and NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ concentration are overall higher in Las Canteras compared to El Confital. Within Las Canteras, these nutrients show a decreasing tendency as we move North. This pattern is representative of different land input regimes, whose shaping agents are the ravines located South of Las Canteras. Ravine discharge contains siliceous sediments from volcanic rocks as well as nitrtates. However, in Figure 4 shows an unusual distribution of NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ at Peña la Vieja, which could be an indicator of anthropogenic input of nutrients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Organic nutrient distribution across sampling stations.

Values tend to decrease between January 2022 and October 2022 for both eukaryotic sizes. However, this tendency is not symmetrical between nano and picoeukaryotes. As observed in Figure 7, picoeukaryotic concentration is stable after summer 2022 whereas nanoeukaryotic increased drastically in autumn 2022. In Figure 8 we observe the minimum at Peña la Vieja during late winter 2022. At El Confital 1, Synechoccocus count fell to a minimum, while Prochlorococcus remained at middle values. Figure 9 shows a decoupling between the otherwise highly correlated concentrations of both genuses. When seasonal variation is considered (Figure 10), we registered minimum values in spring 2022 for HNA. Contrarily, the minimum for LNA happened before, in autumn 2022. This inverse correlation between HNA and LNA can be better observed in Figure 11. There is an evident opposing tendency between HNA and LNA cells due to their reproductive strategies. It has been proposed by Santos et al. (2019) that HNA bacteria flourish during fecal contamination events. This could be the case at hand during summer 2022, when we observed maximum values for HNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Eukaryotic cells temporal distribution.

Relative abundance is preferred over reads because not all samples contained the same number of total ASV reads (Figure 3).

Relative abundance is easily computed by dividing the number of reads of a certain taxon by the total ASV reads within the sample. Figure 5 shows that, overall, rarer taxa are less abundant. Note that, as stated above, there are far more data points in singular and recurring categories than in the ubiquitous category.
